## PEDAC

### P: Understand the Problem

- Establish the rules / define the boundaries of the problem
  - Assess all available information about the problem
  - Questions about the problem specifications?
  - Restating explicit requirements
    - Clearly stated in the explanation of the problem
    - Input / Output
    - Action to be performed on input
  - Identify implicit requirements
    - Based on the questions about the problem specifications
    - Implied based on examples and test cases
- Spend enough time, don't rush this step.

### E: Examples & Test Cases

- Can confirm / refute assumptions
- Help to answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries
- May be provided with these by the problem, or you may need to create additional ones.

### D: Data Structures

- Help reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at an implementation level
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of the problem solving process
- Closely linked to the algorithms which will be used
  - Set of steps from input to output
    - Involve structuring the data in a certain way

### A: Algorithms

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Closely linked to data structures
  - Series of steps to structure data to producte the required output
- Stay abstract and high level
  - Avoid implementation detail
  - Don't worry about efficiency of the algorithm at this time
- Write out the solution using Pseudocode or Flowchart

### C: Implement a Solution in Code

- Translating the solution algorithm into code
- Think about the algorithm in the context of the programming language
  - Language features / constraints
  - Characteristics of the data structures
  - Built in functions / methods
  - Syntax and coding patterns
- Create any test cases that are necessary
- **Code with intent**
